# Deep Mean Field Games

This is the implementation of all experiments conducted for the _arXiv_ preprint [Deep Mean Field Games for Learning Optimal Behavior Policy of Large Populations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.03156)

[ac_irl.py](https://github.com/011235813/discrete_mean_field_game/blob/master/ac_irl.py) is the main code for maximum entropy inverse reinforcement learning and a standard actor-critic RL solver.

[mfg_ac2.py](https://github.com/011235813/discrete_mean_field_game/blob/master/mfg_ac2.py) is an alternative version that implements the same forward RL solver for a pre-specified reward function.

Population data on which experiments were conducted are available upon request.
